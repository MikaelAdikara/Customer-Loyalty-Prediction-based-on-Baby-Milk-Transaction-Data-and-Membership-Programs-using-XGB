**Intellectra Customer Repurchase Prediction**
<br><br>
**Project Overview**
<br> Intellectra is a baby milk manufacturer that offers loyalty points to members for every product purchase. Using historical customer data, transaction records, and product attributes, this project aims to build a **binary classification model** to predict whether a customer will make another purchase in the following month. <br>This project is designed as a **data-driven machine learning challenge**, focusing on customer retention analysis and predictive modeling. <br>
<br>
**Objective**
<br> The main goal of this project is to predict the target variable: <br><br> - **`next_buy`** - `1` → Customer will repurchase in the next month - `0` → Customer will not repurchase in the next month <br><br>

**Key objectives include:**
<br>
- Applying statistical analysis, data analytics, and machine learning techniques
- Extracting meaningful insights from customer and transaction data
- Achieving the best possible performance based on evaluation metrics

<br><br>
**Dataset Description**
<br> The dataset consists of: <br> - **Customer historical data** - **Purchase transaction history** - **Product-related attributes**<br> These features are used to model customer behavior and predict future purchasing decisions. <br>
<br>
**Methodology**
<br> The workflow of this project includes: 
<br> 1. Data cleaning and preprocessing 
<br> 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 
<br> 3. Feature engineering and selection 
<br> 4. Model development using relevant machine learning algorithms 
<br> 5. Model evaluation and performance comparison <br>
<br>
**Evaluation Metrics**
<br> Model performance is evaluated using appropriate classification metrics, such as: <br> - Accuracy - Precision - Recall - F1-Score - ROC-AUC (if applicable) <br>
<br>
**Expected Outcome**
<br> A robust binary classification model capable of accurately predicting customer repurchase behavior, providing valuable insights for **customer loyalty strategies and business decision-making**. <br>
<br>
**Tech Stack**
<br> - Python - Pandas, NumPy - Scikit-learn - Matplotlib / Seaborn - Jupyter Notebook <br>
<br>
**Notes**
<br> This repository is intended for educational and analytical purposes, focusing on real-world customer behavior prediction using data science and machine learning approaches. <br>
